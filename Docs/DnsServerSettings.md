# DnsServerSettings

The DnsServerSettings DSC configuration manages the Domain Name System (DNS) server settings and properties.

If the parameter **DnsServer** is set to `'localhost'` then the resource can normally use the default credentials (SYSTEM) to configure the DNS server settings.

If using any other value for the parameter **DnsServer** make sure that the credential the resource is run as have the correct permissions at the target node and the necessary network traffic is permitted (_WsMan_ protocol). It is possible to run the resource with specific credentials using the built-in parameter **PsDscRunAsCredential**.

Please see [DnsServerSetting class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnsserverpsprov/dnsserversetting) for more information around the properties this resource supports.

The server SHOULD refuse zone transfer requests for no more than ten minutes. The value SHOULD be limited to the range from `0x00000000` to `0x00000064`, inclusive, but it MAY be any value.                                                                                                                               |                |

If the value is zero or is less than the value of **QuietRecvLogInterval*, then the value of **QuietRecvLogInterval** MUST be used. If the value is greater than or equal to the value of **QuietRecvLogInterval**, then the literal value of **QuietRecvFaultInterval** MUST be used.

If the value is zero, logging associated with the two **QuietRecv** properties MUST be disabled, and the **QuietRecvFaultInterval** property MUST be ignored. If the value is non-zero, logging associated with the two **QuietRecv** properties MUST be enabled, and the **QuietRecvFaultInterval** property MUST NOT be ignored.
